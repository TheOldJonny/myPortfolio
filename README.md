# myPortfolio
Some files to present my work as a developer.

Inside the *linked_list.py* file there is the implementation of the singly linked list as a class with its method. There is also a
"main" to present some examples of how it works.

Inside the *project_mysql_professionai.sql* file there is the final project I have presented in the "Master in Data Science" class 
about MySQL. The database analyzed is *db_bancario.sql".
